# Bareos REST API using fastAPI and python-bareos.

Experimental and subject to enhancements and changes.

This is an experimental backend for development purposes.

It provides a REST API using fastapi and python-bareos to connect to
a Bareos director. 

Connexion handles the HTTP requests defined by using OpenAPI
specification.

## Guide

### Installation

Change into the directory with _requirements.txt_, _main.py_ and _api.ini_
* We recommend to create a dedicated Python environment for the installation:

```
python3 -m venv env
# Activate the virtual environment inside the src directory
source env/bin/activate
# Install dependencies into the virtual environment
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Note: _requirements.txt_ contains a list of needed Python-modules, which will get installed by pip. The module _sslpsk==1.0.0_ is commented, because it requires an installed gcc and header files to be installed. Uncomment, if you want encrypted communication between the API and the Bareos director.

### Configuration
Configure your Bareos Server in _api.ini_ adapting these 3 lines of configuration:
```
[Director]
Name=bareos-dir
Address=192.168.122.168
Port=9101
```

TODO: add possibility to connect to a choice of directors

### Start the backend server

```
uvicorn main:app --reload
```

* Serve the Swagger UI to explore the REST API: http://127.0.0.1:8000/docs
* Alternatively you can use the redoc format: http://127.0.0.1:8000/redoc


### Browse
The Swagger UI contains documentation and online-tests. Use "authorize" to connect to your Bareos director using a named console. Read here to learn how to configure
a named console: https://docs.bareos.org/Configuration/Director.html#console-resource

The Swagger documentation also contains CURL statements for all available endpoints.

## Future work

The API will be extended by some methods provided by the Bareos console, that are not yet implemented. It is also planned to add delete / update options for configuration in the director and REST API. If you are interested in support and / or funding enhancements, please visit https://www.bareos.com
